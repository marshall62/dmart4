that the form can be used to modify it).  Endpoint rejects attempts to update artwork (when including
is present until I am certain everything works right))

2/7/25 re-established images in vercel bucket using Pro account since hobby account got frozen and disallowed more
image operations.   Pro account trial expires 2/21 and then I can revert to hobby or continue with pro.

Y Posting a new artwork works

DONE: Editing existing artwork: 
app/api/artworks/route.ts PATCH is able to update artwork

__ GIT wont allow push because I made a commit of todo.txt with a secret in it.  I then made another commit after

Need to figure out solution.

__ Uploaded images (POST and PATCH) are resized in UI but midsize and large are too big.

_ Setting the tags on artwork with auto complete input

_ make dashboard be paginated so that I don't have to scroll so much
