12/31/24:   I have the add artwork form submitting all fields (including for an existing artwork
that the form can be used to modify it).  Endpoint rejects attempts to update artwork (when including
is present until I am certain everything works right))

2/7/25 re-established images in vercel bucket using Pro account since hobby account got frozen and disallowed more
image operations.   Pro account trial expires 2/21 and then I can revert to hobby or continue with pro.
I reduced the size or the large images so that we take up much less bucket storage.   Hobby account may be viable



- Test create, update, delete of artwork.  If working, merge add-tags branch into main branch
- Build a login page and make sure that all the admin pages are only accessible when logged in
- See if I can get the main page of the user website to run in this repo accessing the database to create a context
   with all artworks.
- begin converting the art webapp to use the Vercel API and the data from postgres

Admin:
_ Setting the tags on artwork with auto complete input

_ make dashboard be paginated so that I don't have to scroll so much
