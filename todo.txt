12/31/24:   I have the add artwork form submitting all fields (including for an existing artwork
that the form can be used to modify it).  Endpoint rejects attempts to update artwork (when including
is present until I am certain everything works right))

If uploading a new artwork:

1.  Save the image to the bucket storage DONE
 .  Add endpoint for deleting artwork + image so I can get rid of junk created by testing DONE

. create a git repo for this

2.  Once that works, work on server-side image resizing so that I can insert 3 images in the
bucket storage

3. Editing existing artwork: 
   For updating existing artwork images,  I'll need to remove old ones from bucket

4.  In step 1 above, after deleting an artwork, it remains in the table.
